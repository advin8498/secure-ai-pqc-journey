# Secure AI + PQC Learning Journey

## 🎯 Objective  
I am transitioning into **Cybersecurity with a focus on Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** while developing an **AI Product mindset**.  
This repository documents my structured 12–24 month learning journey with consistent daily practice (1 hour/day).

## 🚀 Goals (12 months)  
- Build strong foundations in Linux, Networking, and Security.  
- Develop hands-on SOC/Blue Team skills.  
- Understand PQC risks and enterprise migration strategies.  
- Gain AI Product intuition for secure AI systems.  
- Create a professional portfolio demonstrating real skills.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure  

- **00-progress-tracker/** → Daily logs, weekly summaries, flashcards  
- **01-linux-network-basics/** → Labs, notes, cheat sheets  
- **02-cyber-home-lab/** → Wireshark + forensics work  
- **03-mini-soc/** → Log analysis + detection scripts  
- **04-incident-reports/** → Realistic security investigations  
- **05-pqc-playbook/** → PQC migration framework  
- **06-ai-product-notes/** → AI product thinking & case studies  
- **07-qiskit-light/** → High-level quantum notebooks (optional)

## 📌 How I Learn  
Every day (60 minutes):  
- 10 min → review + notes  
- 35 min → structured learning  
- 15 min → hands-on practice + Git commit  

## 🎯 End-State Vision  
By the end of this journey, I aim to be:  
- A capable **SOC / Blue Team professional**, and  
- A security practitioner who understands **Post-Quantum Cryptography risks and migration.**
